# Harness Gap Tracker

Tracks gaps identified in the harness engineering setup through production incidents. Each gap represents a regression that our harness system should have prevented.

## Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Mean time to harness (MTTH) | < 7 days | - |
| Open P0 gaps | 0 | 0 |
| Open P1 gaps | < 3 | 0 |
| Gap close rate (monthly) | > 80% | - |
| Repeat regression rate | 0% | 0% |

> Updated weekly by the [weekly-metrics workflow](../.github/workflows/weekly-metrics.yml). Run manually via `workflow_dispatch` for on-demand updates.

## SLO Definitions

| Priority | SLO | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **P0** | 24 hours | Active production breakage. Drop everything. |
| **P1** | 1 week | High-risk gap that could recur imminently. |
| **P2** | 1 sprint | Medium-risk gap with a known workaround. |
| **P3** | Next planning cycle | Defense-in-depth improvement, low urgency. |

## Open Gaps

| # | Title | Priority | Layer | Created | SLO Due |

## Closed Gaps

## Process

1. **Report**: When a production incident occurs, create a [Harness Gap issue](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/harness-gap.md) using the template.
2. **Triage**: Add a priority label (`P0`–`P3`) and identify the harness layer that should have caught it.
3. **Implement**: Add the missing test, rule, or gate. Reference the gap issue in the PR.
4. **Verify**: Confirm the new harness check would have caught the original regression (re-run against the offending commit if possible).
5. **Close**: Close the issue and update this tracker.
6. **Review**: Weekly metrics report verifies SLO compliance and flags overdue gaps.

## Harness Layers Reference

| Layer | Catches | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Pre-commit hooks | Local quality issues before push | Formatting, lint errors, type errors |
| Risk policy gate | Mis-classified PR risk | Tier 3 change merged without manual review |
| CI pipeline | Build/test/lint failures | Broken tests, type errors, lint violations |
| Review agent | Logic errors, missing tests | Untested edge case, missing error handling |
| Browser evidence | Visual/UX regressions | Broken layout, missing UI element |
| Architectural linter | Boundary violations | Core importing from UI, circular deps |
| Structural tests | Harness config drift | Missing critical file, invalid config schema |
