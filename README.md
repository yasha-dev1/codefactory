# CodeFactory

**Automated harness engineering for AI coding agents.**

CodeFactory is a CLI tool that sets up production-grade CI pipelines, code review agents, issue automation, and safety gates for any repository -- all tailored to your stack. Run `codefactory init` and it uses Claude Code (via the Agent SDK) to analyze your repo and generate everything.

## The Problem

Setting up harness engineering for AI coding agents -- as described by [OpenAI's blog on agent-first harness engineering](https://openai.com) and [Ryan Carson's patterns](https://ryancarson.com) -- is complex and manual. A production-ready setup requires:

- Agent instruction files (CLAUDE.md)
- Risk-tiered CI pipelines with SHA discipline
- Automated code review with verdict classification
- Remediation loops for automated fix-and-retry cycles
- Issue triage, planning, and implementation agents
- Pre-commit hooks and architectural boundary enforcement
- Documentation garbage collection
- Incident-to-harness tracking

Doing this by hand for every repo is slow, error-prone, and inconsistent.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g codefactory
cd your-project
codefactory init
```

CodeFactory will:

1. Detect your language, framework, CI provider, and toolchain
2. Ask you a few configuration questions (strictness level, which harnesses to enable)
3. Generate all selected harness files tailored to your stack

## What Gets Generated

CodeFactory produces **16 harnesses**, each targeting a specific aspect of agent-safe development:

| #   | Harness                              | What it generates                                                                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Risk Contract**                    | `harness.config.json` -- defines risk tiers (Tier 1/2/3), critical paths, architectural boundaries    |
| 2   | **CLAUDE.md**                        | Agent instruction file -- the control plane document read by all AI agents working on the repo        |
| 3   | **Documentation Structure**          | `docs/` layout: `architecture.md`, `conventions.md`, `layers.md`                                      |
| 4   | **Pre-commit Hooks**                 | `.husky/pre-commit` + `.lintstagedrc.json` -- formats staged files with Prettier before commit        |
| 5   | **Risk Policy Gate**                 | `scripts/risk-policy-gate.sh` -- classifies changed files into Tier 1/2/3 and outputs required checks |
| 6   | **CI Pipeline**                      | `ci.yml` -- risk-gated CI with conditional jobs based on tier                                         |
| 7   | **Review Agent**                     | `code-review-agent.yml` + `review-agent-rerun.yml` + `auto-resolve-threads.yml`                       |
| 8   | **Remediation Loop**                 | `remediation-agent.yml` -- auto-fix cycle with guard, validation, and protected-file safety           |
| 9   | **Browser Evidence Capture**         | Screenshot and trace capture for UI verification during triage                                        |
| 10  | **PR Templates**                     | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with risk-tier checklists                                          |
| 11  | **Architectural Linters**            | `structural-tests.yml` + `scripts/structural-tests.sh` -- enforces import boundaries                  |
| 12  | **Documentation Garbage Collection** | `doc-gardening.yml` -- weekly scan for stale docs, auto-creates PR with fixes                         |
| 13  | **Incident-to-Harness Loop**         | Converts production incidents into new harness rules                                                  |
| 14  | **Issue Triage**                     | `issue-triage.yml` -- evaluates new issues for quality, routes actionable ones forward                |
| 15  | **Issue Planner**                    | `issue-planner.yml` -- reads the codebase and produces a structured implementation plan               |
| 16  | **Issue Implementer**                | `issue-implementer.yml` -- implements issues, opens PRs, handles review-fix cycles                    |

## GitHub Workflows Reference

CodeFactory generates **14 GitHub Actions workflows**. Here is exactly what each one does:

### 1. `ci.yml` -- Main CI Pipeline

**Triggers:** Pull request (opened/synchronize/reopened), push to `main`, manual dispatch with `pr_number`.

This is the central quality gate. It runs a risk classification first, then conditionally runs downstream jobs based on the tier.

**Jobs:**

| Job                | Runs when   | What it does                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `risk-gate`        | Always      | Runs `scripts/risk-policy-gate.sh` to classify changed files into Tier 1/2/3. Outputs the list of required checks. On push to `main`, defaults to Tier 2. |
| `lint`             | Tier 1+     | Runs `npm run lint` (ESLint).                                                                                                                             |
| `type-check`       | Tier 2+     | Runs `npm run typecheck` (tsc --noEmit).                                                                                                                  |
| `test`             | Tier 2+     | Runs `vitest` with JUnit reporter. Uploads `test-results.xml` as artifact.                                                                                |
| `build`            | Tier 2+     | Runs `npm run build` (tsup).                                                                                                                              |
| `structural-tests` | Tier 2+     | Runs `scripts/structural-tests.sh` to validate architectural boundaries.                                                                                  |
| `harness-smoke`    | Tier 2+     | Validates `harness.config.json` schema, checks CLAUDE.md exists, verifies critical files and workflow files are present.                                  |
| `manual-approval`  | Tier 3 only | Requires a maintainer to approve the `tier3-approval` environment. 24-hour timeout.                                                                       |

All downstream jobs check out at the exact SHA reported by the risk gate (SHA discipline).

### 2. `risk-policy-gate.yml` -- Standalone Risk Classification

**Triggers:** Pull request (opened/synchronize/reopened), manual dispatch with `pr_number`.

Identical logic to the `risk-gate` job in `ci.yml`, but as a standalone workflow. Runs `scripts/risk-policy-gate.sh` and outputs:

- `sha` -- the verified commit SHA
- `tier` -- risk tier number (1, 2, or 3)
- `tier-name` -- friendly name (low, medium, high)
- `required-checks` -- JSON array of checks required for this tier
- `docs-drift` -- whether documentation may be stale
- `review-agent-status` -- review agent disposition

Also runs its own set of lint/type-check/test/build/harness-smoke/manual-approval jobs, gated by tier.

### 3. `code-review-agent.yml` -- Automated Code Review

**Triggers:** Pull request (opened/synchronize), manual dispatch with `pr_number`.

The core review workflow. Steps:

1. **Resolve PR context** -- gets head SHA, base ref, PR number.
2. **Determine risk tier** -- classifies changed files using the same Tier 1/2/3 logic.
3. **Skip if Tier 1** -- doc-only changes don't need review.
4. **SHA deduplication** -- checks PR comments for `<!-- harness-review: {sha} -->` marker. If the same commit was already reviewed, skips.
5. **Create check run** -- marks `review-agent` as in-progress on the PR.
6. **Read review prompt** -- loads `scripts/review-prompt.md` from `origin/main` (not from the PR branch, so the prompt can't be tampered with).
7. **Build prompt** -- combines the review template with CLAUDE.md, harness.config.json, changed files, and risk tier.
8. **Run Claude review** -- invokes `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` with tools limited to Read/Glob/Grep/Bash (no write access). Max 100 turns.
9. **Extract review text** -- parses the execution file JSON for the result.
10. **Post review comment** -- creates a PR comment with the review text, SHA marker, and commit reference.
11. **Run verdict classifier** -- sends the review text to Claude Haiku with a JSON schema to classify as APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT.
12. **Update comment with verdict** -- appends the verdict badge to the review comment.
13. **Complete check run** -- marks the check run as success or neutral.
14. **Check review-fix eligibility** -- if verdict is REQUEST_CHANGES, checks whether the PR has the `agent-pr` label, isn't already escalated, and hasn't exceeded 3 review-fix cycles.
15. **Dispatch implementer** -- if eligible, triggers `issue-implementer.yml` in review-fix mode.
16. **Escalate** -- if max cycles (3) exceeded, adds `agent:needs-judgment` label and posts escalation comment.

### 4. `review-agent-rerun.yml` -- Rerun Request Writer

**Triggers:** Pull request synchronize (new commits pushed).

Posts a SHA-deduplicated comment on the PR requesting re-review. Uses marker `<!-- review-agent-auto-rerun -->` with `sha:{commit}` to ensure only one rerun request per commit.

### 5. `auto-resolve-threads.yml` -- Resolve Bot Review Threads

**Triggers:** Check run completed (name: `review-agent`, conclusion: success).

After the review agent succeeds on a new commit:

1. Finds the PR associated with the check run.
2. Fetches all review comments and groups them by thread.
3. For each thread: if all comments are from bots AND the thread is from a prior commit (not the current SHA), minimizes it using GraphQL (`classifier: RESOLVED`).
4. Posts a summary comment counting resolved threads.

Human comments in threads are always preserved.

### 6. `remediation-agent.yml` -- Automated Fix Loop

**Triggers:** Manual dispatch only (called by the code-review-agent when it finds issues).

**Inputs:** `pr_number`, `head_sha`, `findings` (JSON array).

Steps:

1. **SHA discipline check** -- verifies the PR HEAD still matches `head_sha`. Fails if the branch was updated since dispatch.
2. **Checkout PR branch** -- at the verified SHA.
3. **Run remediation guard** -- `scripts/remediation-guard.ts` evaluates whether remediation should proceed (checks attempt count, security blockers, etc.).
4. **If blocked:** posts a rejection comment listing security blockers and skipped findings.
5. **If approved:**
   - Builds a prompt from `scripts/remediation-agent-prompt.md` + CLAUDE.md + harness.config.json + findings.
   - Runs Claude with max 15 turns.
   - Checks for file changes.
   - **Reverts protected files** -- any changes to `.github/workflows/*`, `harness.config.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, or lock files are automatically reverted.
   - **Validates** -- lint, type-check, tests. If any fail, all changes are reverted.
   - **Commits and pushes** if all validations pass.
   - Adds `remediation-attempt-N` label.
   - Posts an audit comment with validation results table.

### 7. `issue-triage.yml` -- Issue Quality Evaluation

**Triggers:** Issue opened, edited, or reopened.

Steps:

1. **Run triage guard** -- `scripts/issue-triage-guard.ts` decides whether to triage (skips bot issues, duplicate triage, etc.). Detects re-triage when an author updates an issue after `needs-more-info`.
2. **Ensure labels exist** -- creates `needs-more-info`, `agent:plan`, `agent:implement`, `triage:failed`, `needs-human-review` if missing.
3. **Remove needs-more-info** -- on re-triage, removes the old label.
4. **Read triage prompt** -- loads `.codefactory/prompts/issue-triage.md`.
5. **Build prompt** -- combines template with issue number, title, author, body, labels, re-triage flag.
6. **Run Claude triage** -- with JSON schema enforcing structured output: `actionable`, `confidence`, `missingInfo`, `summary`, `suggestedLabels`, `estimatedComplexity`.
7. **Browser reproduction** -- if the verdict flags a UI bug and a dev server is available, runs a Puppeteer-based reproduction attempt with screenshots.
8. **Route decision:**
   - **Actionable + confidence >= 0.7** -- adds `agent:plan` label, dispatches planner.
   - **Actionable + low confidence** -- adds `needs-more-info`, asks clarifying questions.
   - **Not actionable** -- adds `needs-more-info`, lists what's missing.
   - **High complexity** -- adds `needs-human-review`.
   - **Parse failure** -- adds `triage:failed`.
9. **Dispatch planner** -- if approved, triggers `issue-planner.yml`.

### 8. `issue-planner.yml` -- Implementation Planning

**Triggers:** Issue labeled with `agent:plan`, manual dispatch with `issue_number`.

Steps:

1. **Run planner guard** -- `scripts/issue-planner-guard.ts` validates the issue should be planned.
2. **Read planner prompt** -- loads `.codefactory/prompts/issue-planner.md`.
3. **Build prompt** -- combines template with issue details, CLAUDE.md, harness.config.json.
4. **Run Claude planning** -- uses Opus with Read/Glob/Grep/Bash tools (read-only). Max 30 turns. Analyzes the codebase and produces a structured implementation plan.
5. **Post plan comment** -- posts the plan on the issue with `<!-- issue-planner: #N -->` marker.
6. **Add `agent:implement` label** -- signals the implementer to proceed.
7. **Dispatch implementer** -- triggers `issue-implementer.yml`.

### 9. `issue-implementer.yml` -- Issue Implementation + Review-Fix

**Triggers:** Issue labeled with `agent:implement`, manual dispatch with `issue_number` or `pr_number` + `review_fix_cycle`.

Two modes:

**Issue mode** (new implementation):

1. **Run implementer guard** -- validates the issue and generates a branch name.
2. **Create branch** -- `{format}-issue-{N}` from `main`.
3. **Run baseline validation** -- captures current lint/type-check/test/build state.
4. **Extract plan** -- finds the planner comment (`<!-- issue-planner: #N -->`) if one exists.
5. **Build prompt** -- combines `.codefactory/prompts/issue-implementer.md` + issue body + plan + CLAUDE.md + harness.config.json + baseline state.
6. **Run Claude implementation** -- Opus with Edit/Write/Read/Glob/Grep/Bash. Max 100 turns.
7. **Revert protected files** -- workflows, harness config, CLAUDE.md, lock files.
8. **Quality gates** -- lint, type-check, test, build. Only fails on regressions (if a check was passing in baseline but now fails).
9. **Commit, push, create PR** -- with `agent-pr` label, `Closes #N` in body, quality gate results table.
10. **Dispatch CI + review agent** -- triggers `ci.yml`, `risk-policy-gate.yml`, and `code-review-agent.yml` for the new PR.

**Review-fix mode** (fix review feedback):

1. **Run review-fix guard** -- validates the PR and cycle count.
2. **Checkout PR branch** -- at current HEAD.
3. **Extract review feedback** -- finds the latest `REQUEST_CHANGES` review comment.
4. **Add cycle label** -- `review-fix-cycle-N`.
5. **Build prompt** -- issue-implementer template in review-fix mode with the feedback.
6. **Run Claude fix** -- Opus with full tool access. Max 100 turns.
7. **Revert protected files** -- same safety.
8. **Quality gates** -- lint, type-check, test, build. If any fail, posts failure comment, adds `agent:needs-judgment`.
9. **Commit, push** -- if all gates pass.
10. **Dispatch CI + review agent** -- re-runs full pipeline for re-review.

### 10. `doc-gardening.yml` -- Weekly Documentation Maintenance

**Triggers:** Scheduled (every Monday at 9am UTC), manual dispatch.

1. Runs Claude with `scripts/doc-gardening-prompt.md` as the prompt. Max 10 turns.
2. **Safety net** -- reverts any non-documentation files (only `.md`/`.mdx`/`.rst` changes are kept).
3. If documentation changes remain, creates or updates a PR on branch `docs/weekly-gardening` with the `documentation` and `automated` labels.

Catches: stale references to renamed/deleted files, broken internal links, outdated package.json script references, deprecated API mentions.

### 11. `weekly-metrics.yml` -- Harness Gap Tracking

**Triggers:** Scheduled (every Friday at 10am UTC), manual dispatch.

Collects metrics on issues labeled `harness-gap`:

- **MTTH** (Mean Time To Harness) -- average days from open to close.
- **Open gap counts** by priority (P0/P1/P2/P3).
- **Monthly close rate** -- % of gaps closed in the last 30 days.
- **SLO compliance** -- flags overdue gaps (P0: 1d, P1: 7d, P2: 14d, P3: 90d).

Outputs a summary table to the GitHub Actions step summary.

### 12. `structural-tests.yml` -- Architectural Boundary Validation

**Triggers:** Manual dispatch, called by CI.

Three checks:

1. **Architectural boundaries** -- runs `scripts/structural-tests.sh`.
2. **Import-type discipline** -- flags imports from `*types*` modules that don't use `import type`.
3. **No circular imports** -- verifies: `utils/` imports nothing, `core/` only imports from `utils/`, `ui/` only imports from `utils/`.

### 13. `harness-smoke.yml` -- Harness Configuration Validation

**Triggers:** Manual dispatch, called by CI.

Validates:

- `harness.config.json` schema (version, riskTiers with tier1/2/3, commands, shaDiscipline, architecturalBoundaries).
- CLAUDE.md is present and non-empty.
- Critical project files exist (src/index.ts, src/cli.ts, package.json, tsconfig.json, tsup.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, eslint.config.js).
- CI workflow files exist.
- PR template exists.
- Risk policy gate script exists.
- Structural tests script exists.

### 14. `claude.yml` -- Manual @claude Invocation

**Triggers:** Issue comment, PR review comment, issue opened/assigned, PR review submitted -- all containing `@claude`.

Runs `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` with the comment as the prompt. Allows team members to invoke Claude ad-hoc on any issue or PR by mentioning `@claude`.

Tier 3 critical paths include: `src/index.ts`, `src/cli.ts`, `src/commands/init.ts`, `src/core/*.ts`, `src/harnesses/index.ts`, `src/harnesses/types.ts`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsup.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`.

## Control Plane

All agent behavior is configured through files committed to the repo:

```
.codefactory/prompts/           Agent prompt templates (edit to change behavior)
    ├── agent-system.md         Base system prompt for all agents
    ├── issue-triage.md         Triage evaluation criteria
    ├── issue-planner.md        Planning instructions
    ├── issue-implementer.md    Implementation instructions
    └── review-agent.md         Code review guidelines

scripts/
    ├── review-prompt.md        Review agent prompt (read from main branch)
    ├── remediation-agent-prompt.md    Remediation agent prompt
    ├── doc-gardening-prompt.md        Doc gardening instructions
    ├── risk-policy-gate.sh     Risk classification script
    ├── structural-tests.sh     Architectural boundary checks
    ├── issue-triage-guard.ts   Triage guard logic
    ├── issue-planner-guard.ts  Planner guard logic
    ├── issue-implementer-guard.ts     Implementer guard logic
    └── remediation-guard.ts    Remediation guard logic

harness.config.json             Risk tiers, architectural boundaries, critical paths
CLAUDE.md                       Project conventions for all agents
```

Changes to these files take effect on the next CI run. Because they are committed to the repo, agent behavior is versioned and shared with the whole team.

## Architecture

```
CLI (Commander)
  ├── Default ──► REPL (interactive input with / commands)
  │                ├── Task input ──► Worktree + Claude agent
  │                └── /prompts ──► View/edit .codefactory/prompts/
  └── init ──► Harness setup wizard
                 ├── Detector (heuristic + Claude-powered analysis)
                 └── Harness Modules (16 modules, each implementing HarnessModule)
                      └── Claude Runner (Agent SDK) ──► Generated Files
```

**Core modules:**

- `src/core/claude-runner.ts` -- Wraps the Claude Code Agent SDK. Provides `analyze()` for structured JSON extraction (read-only tools, Zod schema validation) and `generate()` for file creation (read + write tools).
- `src/core/detector.ts` -- Two-phase stack detection: fast heuristics (file existence checks, package.json parsing) followed by Claude-powered deep analysis.
- `src/core/config.ts` -- Loads and saves `harness.config.json`.
- `src/core/file-writer.ts` -- Tracks created and modified files during harness generation.
- `src/core/prompt-store.ts` -- Manages `.codefactory/prompts/` with default agent prompts and CRUD operations.
- `src/commands/init.ts` -- Orchestrates the init flow: detect, prompt, generate.
- `src/commands/repl.ts` -- Interactive REPL with search-based input, prompt management, and task spawning.

**Harness modules** (`src/harnesses/`): 16 modules each exporting a `HarnessModule` with `name`, `order`, `isApplicable()`, and `execute()`. They run in dependency order and can reference outputs from earlier harnesses via `previousOutputs`.

**Prompts** (`src/prompts/`): 20 prompt builders that each harness module sends to the Claude Runner for file generation. Agent-facing prompts (read at CI time) live in `.codefactory/prompts/`.

## Development
